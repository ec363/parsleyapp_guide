## A Guide to the Parsley App
<img src="inst/www/parsley_png.png" align="right" height="200px"/>

This repository houses the code for the Parsley App Guide.

To access the guide, follow the link below.

While the app itself has (the identical) Guide built in, the Guide here is in a more accessible (Bookdown) format, that users may find easier to navigate.

Shiny Apps are powerful platforms for interactive applications but they restrict users to 1 session at a time, and time out after 15 minutes. Bookdown websites do not time out, and having a separate guide allows users to have both the app and guide open at the same time, allowing user to check the guidance without interrupting their use of the App.
